Network Software Development
Student ID=C1026448

This is my assignment for the module on Network Software Development.
The contents of my archive are listed down below:
1)The source code including the json library and javafx library.
2) The video demonstration
3) The README file

To run the source code that I have created is quite simple. Once you open a project you can load the classes that I have coded onto it or also open the folder as a whole. It is necessary to check whether the libraries have opened too while opening the project as a folder since this might sometimes cause errors.
Both the client and the server are connected to port 12356
The server should be run first and then the client, I have made sure multiple instances of EEchoClient can be made in order to show multi-threading.
If the libraries have not opened and cannot be accessed, they can be accessed easily through the File-> Project Structure->library and the appropriate javafx library can be added from there.

I have created just two classes: An EEchoClient and EnhancedEchoServer with a ClientHandler class
EEchoClient serves as the client while ExtraEnhancedEchoServer serves as the server.
I have incorporated GUI in my assignment up to my knowledge. The server allows multiple clients to connect while also having a shared message board.

There are three external libraries that I have used in this assignment- the javafx which is the main component for the GUI(graphical user interface) to work. I have also included the JSON jar file which is required to use JSON. Lastly the standard JDK.

I made several attempts at trying to use extensions but could not manage to figure out the right way to incorporate them into the code.
